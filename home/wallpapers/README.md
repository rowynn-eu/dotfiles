# Introduction
Redistributing wallpapers that contain artwork by human artists feels kinda scummy, and I don't use any AI-generated wallpapers for other other personal reasons. Because of that I can't really upload most of my wallpapers to this repo. Only those that have been 100% made by me will be uploaded here.

Instead, check out [this collection](https://github.com/AngelJumbo/gruvbox-wallpapers/tree/main/wallpapers). I'm sure that repo owner has taken the required steps to (ethically) distribute these...

### Making your own wallpapers
If you want to make your own wallpapers you first need to find something you like. Stick to something with simple backgrounds (preferably darker colours), then inside of your preferred image-editing software you stretch it out to 16:9 or 16:10.   

Photoshop's content-aware-scaling works most of the time, but sometimes I have to make my own background and blend it together with the artwork itself to get the desired resolution.

I run all my wallpapers through [gruvbox-factroy](https://github.com/paulopacitti/gruvbox-factory) with manual tweaking afterwards in Photoshop (or similar software) if I'm unhappy with the result.

To upscale my wallpapers to 1440p I use a traditional upscaler that interpolates pixels (the one from photoshop works just fine). If it looks particularly blurry, I resort to using [Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl).
